# Lead Rejection System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to implement the Lead Rejection System for Branch Heads in the Ather CRM system. When a Branch Head rejects a lead, it sets the `lead_status` to "rejected by BH" and `final_status` to "pending" so that PS users can take follow-up again.

## Changes Made

### 1. Branch Head Dashboard (`templates/bh_dashboard.html`)

#### Added Reject Button
- Added a red "Reject" button next to the existing "Approve" button in the approval leads table
- Button calls `rejectLead()` function with lead details

#### Added Rejection Modal
- Created a new modal (`#rejectModal`) for rejection workflow
- Includes rejection remarks textarea with validation
- Quick remark templates for common rejection reasons:
  - Customer not ready for purchase
  - Documents incomplete
  - Payment issues
  - Customer concerns
- Modal shows lead information and explains the rejection process

#### Added JavaScript Functions
- `rejectLead()`: Opens rejection modal and stores lead data
- `useRejectRemarkTemplate()`: Fills rejection remarks with template text
- `submitRejection()`: Submits rejection via API and handles response
- Search functionality for rejected leads table

### 2. New API Endpoint (`app.py`)

#### Added `/api/bh_reject_lead` endpoint
- **Method**: POST
- **Authentication**: Requires Branch Head access
- **Parameters**:
  - `source_table`: Table containing the lead (ps_followup, activity_leads, walkin_table, lead_master)
  - `lead_id`: ID of the lead to reject
  - `remarks`: Required rejection remarks

#### Rejection Logic
- Updates `approval_status` to "Rejected"
- Sets `lead_status` to "rejected by BH" (for ps_followup_master and activity_leads)
- Sets `final_status` to "pending" (for all tables)
- Records rejection timestamp and Branch Head details
- Updates both source table and lead_master for consistency
- Logs audit event for tracking

### 3. PS Dashboard Updates (`templates/ps_dashboard.html`)

#### Added Rejected Leads Tab
- New tab "Rejected Leads" with red icon
- Shows leads rejected by Branch Head
- Displays rejection details including:
  - Customer information
  - Rejection remarks (viewable via button)
  - Rejection timestamp
  - Who rejected the lead

#### Rejected Leads Table
- Action buttons to update rejected leads
- Status badge showing "Rejected by BH"
- Search functionality for rejected leads
- Integration with existing PS dashboard workflow

### 4. PS Dashboard Backend (`app.py`)

#### Added Rejected Leads Processing
- Initialized `rejected_leads` list
- Added logic to identify leads with `lead_status = 'rejected by BH'`
- Processes rejected leads from all sources:
  - `ps_followup_master`
  - `activity_leads`
  - `walkin_table`
- Passes rejected leads data to PS dashboard template

### 5. Database Schema Updates

#### New Status Values
- `lead_status`: "rejected by BH" (new status for rejected leads)
- `approval_status`: "Rejected" (new approval status)
- `final_status`: "pending" (when lead is rejected, allows PS to take follow-up)

#### Tables Affected
- `ps_followup_master`
- `lead_master`
- `activity_leads`
- `walkin_table`

### 6. Documentation Updates

#### Updated `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- Added rejection workflow description
- Updated status transition rules
- Added new API endpoint documentation
- Updated testing instructions

#### Updated `approval_system_sql.sql`
- Added comments about rejection functionality
- Documented new status values

## Workflow Summary

### Branch Head Rejection Process
1. Branch Head sees leads waiting for approval
2. Clicks "Reject" button on specific lead
3. Enters rejection remarks in modal
4. System updates lead status:
   - `lead_status` → "rejected by BH"
   - `final_status` → "pending"
   - `approval_status` → "Rejected"
5. Lead is returned to PS for follow-up

### PS Follow-up Process
1. PS sees rejected lead in "Rejected Leads" tab
2. Can view rejection remarks and details
3. Can update lead status and continue follow-up
4. Lead appears with "pending" final status

## Security Features

- **Access Control**: Only Branch Head users can access rejection endpoints
- **Branch Isolation**: Branch Head can only reject leads from their branch
- **Audit Logging**: All rejection actions are logged with user details
- **Input Validation**: Rejection remarks are required

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Login as Branch Head**
   - Navigate to "Leads Waiting for Approval" tab
   - Verify "Reject" button appears next to "Approve" button

2. **Test Rejection Workflow**
   - Click "Reject" on a lead
   - Verify rejection modal appears
   - Enter rejection remarks and submit
   - Verify lead disappears from approval list

3. **Verify Database Changes**
   - Check that `lead_status` is "rejected by BH"
   - Check that `final_status` is "pending"
   - Check that `approval_status` is "Rejected"

4. **Login as PS**
   - Navigate to "Rejected Leads" tab
   - Verify rejected lead appears
   - Verify rejection details are displayed correctly

### Automated Testing
- Run `test_rejection_system.py` to test API endpoints
- Verify all dashboard endpoints are accessible
- Check error handling and validation

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Email Notifications**: Alert PS when leads are rejected
2. **Rejection Categories**: Predefined rejection reasons for analytics
3. **Escalation Rules**: Auto-escalate rejected leads after certain time
4. **Bulk Rejections**: Reject multiple leads at once
5. **Rejection History**: Track all rejection actions over time

### Configuration Options
1. **Rejection Thresholds**: Set maximum rejection rate per PS
2. **Auto-approval Rules**: Automatic approval for certain conditions
3. **Rejection Workflow**: Custom rejection approval process

## Files Modified

1. `templates/bh_dashboard.html` - Added rejection UI
2. `app.py` - Added rejection API and PS dashboard logic
3. `templates/ps_dashboard.html` - Added rejected leads tab
4. `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Updated documentation
5. `approval_system_sql.sql` - Added comments
6. `test_rejection_system.py` - Test script (new file)
7. `REJECTION_SYSTEM_CHANGES.md` - This summary (new file)

## Conclusion

The Lead Rejection System has been successfully implemented with:
- ✅ Reject button and modal for Branch Heads
- ✅ API endpoint for lead rejection
- ✅ Database updates for rejected leads
- ✅ PS dashboard integration for rejected leads
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and testing
- ✅ Security and audit features

The system now provides a complete workflow for Branch Heads to reject leads and return them to PS users for follow-up, maintaining data integrity and providing clear audit trails.
